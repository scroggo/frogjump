# Frog Jump

Inspired by the [1-Button Jam](https://itch.io/jam/1-button-jam-2024). Work in progress game as I learn to use the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/). Also one of my first attempts to use Rust in an actual project, thanks to [godot-rust](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/index.html).

## How to play

Go to [scroggo.itch.io/frogjump](https://scroggo.itch.io/frogjump) to play the web version.
